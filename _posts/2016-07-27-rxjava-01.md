### Preface ###
I have been spending more than half year to learn RxJava, especially how to use it on Android platform. And one of the most important reason to push me learn this knowledge is our current project which has ton thousand of code and callbacks to handle the asynchrnous staffs, and you will be very quickly lost into looking at such kind of source code. But **RxJava** is one of the technologies to save me from that hell.

### What's RxJava ###
> ReactiveX is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.
> 
> It extends the observer pattern to support sequences of data and/or events and adds operators that allow you to compose sequences together declaratively while abstracting away concerns about things like low-level threading, synchronization, thread-safety, concurrent data structures, and non-blocking I/O.
[More](http://reactivex.io/intro.html)

Above is the official introduction in a high level layer. But for me, its actually just one word - **Asynchronous** which is a awesome library to help implementing kinds asynchrnous operations.

### Why should I consider RxJava ###
> Reactive Programming raises the level of abstraction of your code so you can focus on the interdependence of events that define the business logic, rather than having to constantly fiddle with a large amount of implementation details. Code in RP will likely be more concise.
>
> The benefit is more evident in modern webapps and mobile apps that are highly interactive with a multitude of UI events related to data events. 10 years ago, interaction with web pages was basically about submitting a long form to the backend and performing simple rendering to the frontend. Apps have evolved to be more real-time: modifying a single form field can automatically trigger a save to the backend, "likes" to some content can be reflected in real time to other connected users, and so forth.
>
> Apps nowadays have an abundancy of real-time events of every kind that enable a highly interactive experience to the user. We need tools for properly dealing with that, and Reactive Programming is an answer. [More](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754)

But to me, its also one word -
**Concision**

One of the most important key point of asynchrnouse operation is the concision. Why do I need to use AsyncTask, Handler, ThreadExecutor and all kinds of other tools to implement the same goal of synchronous? Why wouldn't I just use one technology to do all of them alignment? That's how RxJava does! 

RxJava provids a consistent and concise way to make it easy to use, and could keep concise all the time even the logic of the whole app becomes more and more complexy.

**For example**

There is a customized view called `imageCollectorView` which is used to display multiple images, and there is a method called `addImage(Bitmap)` to add any image for displaying. Assuming our app needs to load all the images under some directories `File[] folders` and display all of into `imageCollectorView`. **But** there are somethings we need to take more carefully: Reading image from local file system really costs and it has to be put into background thread instead of doing in UI Thread. And displaying image into view has to be running in UI Thread. There are lots of way to handle it, here is one of them:

```java
new Thread() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        super.run();
        for (File folder : folders) {
            File[] files = folder.listFiles();
            for (File file : files) {
                if (file.getName().endsWith(".png")) {
                    final Bitmap bitmap = getBitmapFromFile(file);
                    getActivity().runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {
                        @Override
                        public void run() {
                            imageCollectorView.addImage(bitmap);
                        }
                    });
                }
            }
        }
    }
}.start();
```

But if we are using RxJava, here is the implementation:

```java
Observable.from(folders)
    .flatMap(new Func1<File, Observable<File>>() {
        @Override
        public Observable<File> call(File file) {
            return Observable.from(file.listFiles());
        }
    })
    .filter(new Func1<File, Boolean>() {
        @Override
        public Boolean call(File file) {
            return file.getName().endsWith(".png");
        }
    })
    .map(new Func1<File, Bitmap>() {
        @Override
        public Bitmap call(File file) {
            return getBitmapFromFile(file);
        }
    })
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
    .subscribe(new Action1<Bitmap>() {
        @Override
        public void call(Bitmap bitmap) {
            imageCollectorView.addImage(bitmap);
        }
    });
```

Wait! Wait! Hold on! I know you guys will complain that: the whole code lines are obviously much more than the old one, why did you say it becomes more concise? - Okay! I got your point, but the concision I'm talking means the concision of code logic, not just the lines of code. If you are reading the code above, you will find that the implementation by RxJava is a chain execution instead of calling nesting which can help us simplify the logic, especially when your app's requirement and design becomes more complex. 

So if you asked me why should I use RxJava, I would say **Concision** which will put all the complex logic into one chain.

### How to use RxJava ###
Before we start talking how to use RxJava, I would spend some time to go through the API and philosophy of RxJava.

1. Concept: Extend of [observer pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)
2. Basic philosophy
    
    * Create Observer
    
        Observer is the role to be responsible for listerning the event when it gets triggerred.

    ```java
    Observer<String> observer = new Observer<String>() {
        @Override
        public void onNext(String s) {
            Log.d(tag, "Item: " + s);
        }
        
        @Override
        public void onCompleted() {
            Log.d(tag, "Completed!");
        }
        
        @Override
        public void onError(Throwable e) {
            Log.d(tag, "Error!");
        }
    };
    ```
    
        Beside *Observer*, there is another class which simplely implements `Observer`: `Subscriber`. `Subscriber` extends the API of `Observer`, but the basic functions are exactly same:
        
        ```java
        Subscriber<String> subscriber = new Subscriber<String>() {
            @Override
            public void onNext(String s) {
                Log.d(tag, "Item: " + s);
            }
            
            @Override
           public void onCompleted() {
                Log.d(tag, "Completed!");
            }
            
        @Override
            public void onError(Throwable e) {
                Log.d(tag, "Error!");
            }
        };
        ```
        
        Actually, `Observer` will be translated to `Subscriber` inside RxJava when it gets invoked. So if you are only using the basic funtions, they are exactly the same. The only difference is:
        
        * `onStart()`: This is the new method of `Subscriber` and it will get called when subscribe just begins before sending out which could be used to do some preparations, such as data reset. It's a optional method and empty of default impelmentation.
            
        * `unsubscribe()`: It's used to cancel the subscription. After it's called, `Subscriber` will not accept any event. Usually, you can use `usUnsubscribed()` before calling it. `unsubscribe()` is very important, because the `Observable` will keep the reference of `Subscriber` after `subscribe()` gets called. If the reference doesn't release in-time, it will cause memory leaking! So keeping in mind: call `unsubscribe()` to release the hard link once you are done everything and call them in proper place.

    * Create observable
    
        Observable is the guy who has event triggerred on when and how. RxJava uses `create()` method to make an Observable, and defines the rules.
        
        ```java
        Observable observable = Observable.create(new Observable.OnSubscribe<String>() {
            @Override
            public void call(Subscriber<? super String> subscriber) {
                subscriber.onNext("Hello");
                subscriber.onNext("Hi");
                subscriber.onNext("Aloha");
                subscriber.onCompleted();
            }
        });
        ```
            
        `create()` accepts the `onSubscribe` object as the paramter. When `observable` gets subscribed, the method `call()` of `onSubscribe` will be called automatically, and the events get triggerred in streaming(just like above with three times `onNext()` and one time `onCompleted()`). This is what we called - `Observer Pattern`
            
        `create()` is the very basic method used to create event sequentially, there are some extra ways to help creating them more quckly:
            
        `just(T...)`: Send out all the parameters in streaming.
            
        ```java
        Observable observable = Observable.just("Hello", "Hi", "Aloha");
        // Same as below
        // onNext("Hello");
        // onNext("Hi");
        // onNext("Aloha");
        // onCompleted();
        ```
        
        `from(T[])`/`from(Iterable<? extends T>)`: Actually its same as `just(T...)`
        
        ```java
        String[] words = {"Hello", "Hi", "Aloha"};
        Observable observable = Observable.from(words);
        // onNext("Hello");
        // onNext("Hi");
        // onNext("Aloha");
        // onCompleted();
        ```
    
    * Subscribe
    
        After `Observable` and `Observer` are created, using `subscribe()` to connect them:
            
        ```java
        observable.subscribe(observer)
        // or
        observable.subscribe(subscriber)
        ```
            
        > You may get confused of `subscribe()` method: it seems to be like `observable` is subscribing `observer`/`subscriber` instead of `observer`/`subscriber` subscribe the `observable`. Yes, you are right, but if the API changes to `observer.subscribe(observable)`, it will break the whole streaming API which is not good for the whole design. You can just treat the `subscribe()` method to be like `getSubscribedBy()` for your convenient.
            
        The `subscribe()` method is working like below:
            
        ```java
        public Subscription subscribe(Subscriber subscriber) {
            subscriber.onStart();
            onSubscribe.call(subscriber);
            return subscriber;
        }
        ```
            
        Lets see what `subscribe()` does:
        
        * Call `Subscriber.onStart()`. This method is optional.
        * Call `OnSubscribe.call(Subscriber)`. Here is the point of whole event logic started. So in RxJava, the event in `Observable` is not delivered when `Observable` is created, by instead, it's triggerred when the `subscribe()` method get called.
        * Return the `Subscriber` which is extending `Subscription`. So you can unsubscribe it anytime.
            
        The whole process can be like this:
        ![](https://github.com/jp-wang/jp-wang.github.io/blob/master/images/rxjava/rxjava-basic-process.jpg)
        Or
        ![](https://github.com/jp-wang/jp-wang.github.io/blob/master/images/rxjava/rxjava-basic-process-dynamic.gif)
            
        And you can also create actions like below, and RxJava will automatically generate the `Subscriber` to wrapper these actions.
            
        ```java
        Action1<String> onNextAction = new Action1<String>() {
            // onNext()
            @Override
            public void call(String s) {
                Log.d(tag, s);
            }
        };
        Action1<Throwable> onErrorAction = new Action1<Throwable>() {
            // onError()
            @Override
            public void call(Throwable throwable) {
                // Error handling
            }
        };
        Action0 onCompletedAction = new Action0() {
            // onCompleted()
            @Override
            public void call() {
                Log.d(tag, "completed");
            }
        };
            
        // Automatically create Subscriber, and call onNextAction to define onNext()
        observable.subscribe(onNextAction);
            
        observable.subscribe(onNextAction, onErrorAction);
            
        observable.subscribe(onNextAction, onErrorAction, onCompletedAction);
        ```
            
        `Action0` only has only one method `call()` which has no parameter and return. Actually it's mapping into the method `onCompleted()` in `Subscriber`.
            
        `Action1` is similar which has only one method `void call(T param)` and can be mapped into `onNext(T obj)` and `onError(Throwable error)`.
            
        `ActionX` there are kinds of format like that and provided by RxJava to handle different cases.
        
    * Usage
    
        > I just pick up a few simple scenarios.
    
        Print array
            
        ```java
        String[] names = ...;
        Observable.from(names)
            .subscribe(new Action1<String>() {
                @Override
                public void call(String name) {
                    Log.d(tag, name);
                }
        });
        ```
            
        Get drawable and display it
            
        ```java
        int drawableRes = ...;
        ImageView imageView = ...;
        Observable.create(new OnSubscribe<Drawable>() {
            @Override
            public void call(Subscriber<? super Drawable> subscriber) {
                Drawable drawable = getTheme().getDrawable(drawableRes));
                subscriber.onNext(drawable);
                subscriber.onCompleted();
            }
        }).subscribe(new Observer<Drawable>() {
            @Override
            public void onNext(Drawable drawable) {
                imageView.setImageDrawable(drawable);
            }
            
            @Override
            public void onCompleted() {
            }
            
            @Override
            public void onError(Throwable e) {
                Toast.makeText(activity, "Error!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            }
        });
        ```
    
    But, this is still useless!!!
    
    Yes! You are right! In the usual way that we are using RxJava, the event triggering and consuming is called in same thread! But in most usages of `Observer Pattern`, it should be *Handling in background, Get notified in foreground*! So let's introduce another important part in RxJava - **Scheduler**.
    
3. Scheduler

    Usually, RxJava handles things in same thread which means: the event will be triggerred in the thread where `subscribe()` get called; the event will also be consumed in the thread where it is triggered. Fortunately, RxJava provides a very cool guys - `Scheduler` to help us switching between different threads.
    
    Bascially, `Scheduler` is like a thread controller. RxJava uses it to assign the codes running in what kind of threads. For example,
    * `Schedulers.immediate()`: It's default `Scheduler`, which means keep running in current thread.
    * `Schedulers.newThread()`: Always launch a new thread to run it.
    * `Schedulers.io()`: I/O related operation should be put in this `Scheduler`. It's similar as `newThread()`, the only difference it `io()` will use thread pool to maintain the threads and try to reuse them.
    * `Schedulers.computation()`: All CPU-intensive computing tasks should be in this `Scheduler`. It's using fixed number thread pool and the size is equal to CPU core. DON'T put I/O operations into `computation()` which will waste the CPU computation.
    * `AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()`: Android specified to put tasks running in Android main thread.
    
    With these `Scheduler`, you can now use `subscribeOn()` and `observerOn()` to control the threads.
    * `subscribeOn()`: Assign the thread for `subscribe()`, that means which thread the `Observable.OnSubscribe` should run. Usually, we called it the thread of event triggerred.
    * `observeOn()`: Assign the thread of `Subscriber` should be running. Usually, we called it the thread of event consumed.
    
    ```java
    Observable.just(1, 2, 3, 4)
        .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io()) // Assign IO thread ppols for subscribe()
        .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()) // Assign main thread for Subscriber
        .subscribe(new Action1<Integer>() {
            @Override
            public void call(Integer number) {
                Log.d(tag, "number:" + number);
            }
        });
    ```
    
    The event of `1`,`2`,`3`,`4` will be triggerred in I/O thread, and the printing into log will be executed in main thread.
    
    Same change on the example of displaying image:
    
    ```java
    int drawableRes = ...;
    ImageView imageView = ...;
    Observable.create(new OnSubscribe<Drawable>() {
        @Override
        public void call(Subscriber<? super Drawable> subscriber) {
            Drawable drawable = getTheme().getDrawable(drawableRes));
            subscriber.onNext(drawable);
            subscriber.onCompleted();
        }
    })
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io()) 
    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
    .subscribe(new Observer<Drawable>() {
        @Override
        public void onNext(Drawable drawable) {
            imageView.setImageDrawable(drawable);
        }
    
        @Override
        public void onCompleted() {
        }
    
        @Override
        public void onError(Throwable e) {
            Toast.makeText(activity, "Error!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        }
    });
    ```
